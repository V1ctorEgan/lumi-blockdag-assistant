## 🚀 Overview

### 💡 The Problem

Managing crypto assets still feels like programming.  
Users must jump between explorers, wallets, and DeFi dashboards just to check balances, gas fees, or send tokens.  
This complexity keeps new users away and slows down decentralized adoption.

### 🌈 The Solution

**Lumi** turns blockchain interaction into a simple conversation.  
Just chat naturally:

> 🗣️ “What’s my BDAG balance?”  
> 🗣️ “How much gas did I spend this week?”  
> 🗣️ “Send 0.05 BDAG to @alex.”  
> 🗣️ “Alert me when my portfolio drops by 5%.”

Powered by **BlockDAG’s scalable, high-speed architecture**, Lumi delivers **instant wallet insights** and **smart AI suggestions** — without latency or congestion.
